# lib_nc-occ 
### Abstraction layer for NextCloud Management Console (occ) 

Python based library for the [occ management](https://docs.nextcloud.com/server/stable/admin_manual/occ_command.html) console on [NextCloud Servers](https://github.com/nextcloud).

### Features:
- Almost complete Nextcloud management console api mirrored into handy python classes.
- Handles [communication](#communicating-with-occ) with occ
- Powerful tool in combination with nc_py_api for your ExApp apps.

### _How it's done_

Bulk of the code has been generated by 2 scripts:
 
 - One script generating the skeletons dicts based on the occ api
 - A second script generating all the class files from those dicts

### _How it works_

Every generated class inherits from a base class that does the greatest

### Installation
**- Pip local**
- Download the latest release here.
- Extract the zip, then

```
python3 pip install path/to/dwn/load
```

**- Pip repo**
- in the workings

**- Build**
- Clone this repository
- cd into it & run

```
make build
```
- then
```
python3 pip install path/to/dwn/lib_nc_occ
```

### _Usage_

- Complete import
```
from lib_occ import nc_occ

files_api = nc_occ.Files()
files_api.scan()

# Bigger parts of a section are objects
# These are properties

files.object.info()  #object

ff.object.multi.rename_config()  #object & multi


```
- Section & classes import

>[!NOTE]
> Names for classes are composed with this schema:
>
> {prefix}{BaseClass}{Child1}{ChildN}
>
> The full name for the class "appapi:daemon:registry:"
>
> NcOccAppapiDaemonRegistry
> 

```
from lib_occ.nc_occ import Tag, Config
from lib_occ.appapi import NcOccAppiDaemon

tags = Tag()
config = Config()

# Watches for reserved words. Adds "s" at the end 
tags.lists() 
config.imports()

api_daemons = Appapi.daemon
api_daemons.lists()
```

### _Communicating with occ_

Communication with occ happens through sudo, as you have to impersonate(sudo) **www-data**.
If your script / application runs on a webserver or directly in Nextcloud, you're good to go as they run under **www-data**

#### root

In its initial state after installation, only root has sudo rights.
And rightly so, because

>With great powers comes gereat responsibility 

Running a maintenance script as root which includes lib_occ will not fail, but any other user will.
