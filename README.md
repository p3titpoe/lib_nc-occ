# lib_nc-occ 
### Abstraction layer for NextCloud Management Console (occ) 

Pure python based library for OCC.

### Features:
- Almost complete Nextcloud management console api mirrored into handy python classes.
- Handles communication with occ
- Powerful tool in combination with nc_py_api for your ExApp apps.

### How it's done

Bulk of the code has been generated by 2 scripts:
 
 - One script generating the skeletons dicts based on the occ api
 - A second script generating all the class files from those dicts

### How it works

Every generated class inherits from a base class that does the greatest
